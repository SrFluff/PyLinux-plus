# PyLinux-plus
PyLinux on its own with a few more features and some smoother file system navigation

A more trimmed and improved version of the PyLinux that comes with PyShell

It's also made to be forked and edited, to learn how, run the doc command to see the documentation

It's pretty small ngl :3
